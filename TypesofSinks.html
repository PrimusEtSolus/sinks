				<h2>Style</h2>
				<p class="padding-sm center-align">There are four major sink styles:</p>
				</div>
				<ul class="col-4">
					<li>
						<h3>Undermount</h3>

				</ul>
				<div class="text-content text-content-2nd">
					<p><em>Undermount</em> sinks are the most common style that our customers choose. Their distinctive advantage is that they are mounted under the countertop.  This allows counters to be cleaned easily.</p>
					<p><em>Overmount</em> sinks sit on top of the countertop.  The rim of the sink provides a nice accent to the stone, and allows the sink to become a more prominent feature of the countertop.</p>
					<p><em>Farmhouse</em> sinks are generally mounted under the countertop.  The defining feature is that the front of the sink is exposed.  These sinks can provide a rustic feel to your kitchen, but also work remarkably well with modern designs.</p>
					<p><em>Vessel</em> sinks sit on top of the countertop, fully exposed.  They are generally used in bathrooms or utility areas. They provide a beautiful decorative accent to your countertop.</p>
					<p>There is no right or wrong style.  Your choice&#42; will come down to personal preference and taste.</p>

				<p><em>Stainless steel</em> and <em>Composite</em> are the most commonly used materials for kitchen sinks.  Composite sinks have the added advantage of coming in many different colors.  Both materials are very durable and should last a long time, with proper care and maintenance.</p>
				<p><em>Cast Iron</em> sinks, while not as common, are still used in both vanities and kitchens.  They are very durable, but also very heavy and require extra work to install.</p>
				<p><em>Porcelain</em> sinks are chosen for more than 90&#37; of the vanity jobs that we install. They come in both overmount and undermount styles.  Due to their tendency to break or chip upon heavy impact, they are not advised for kitchen sinks, but they are a perfect choice for vanities.</p>
				<p><em>Copper</em> and <em>Glass</em> sinks are more common in vanities. They often come in vessel style sinks that add an elegant feel to bathroom projects.</p>
				<p><em>Natural Stone</em> sinks, made from materials such as granite, marble, onyx or travertine, are a far less common choice for most homeowners.  They look amazing, but are very expensive and durability can be an issue.</p>
				</div>
				<p class="wider text-content-2nd">&#42;Make sure that the sink you pick will physically fit in the cabinet space of your kitchen or vanity.  This is especially true for undermount sinks.  The most common mistake that our customers make is to pick a sink that is too large for their cabinet space.</p>
